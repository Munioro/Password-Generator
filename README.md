# Password-Generator
In this Homework the html and css was already created. I had to write the javascript for generating a random password with that is 8-128 characters long. The page prompts the following before generating the password:

* do you want to inlude a lowercase letter
* do you want to inlude a uppercase letter
* do you want to inlude a number
* do you want to inlude a special character

After selecting at least one requirement it will generate a random password and display it on the page.
